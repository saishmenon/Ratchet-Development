# Ratchet

Ratchet is an open-source project whose goal is to create software that can be used by large groups of people to construct attack trees. The value of an attack tree increases when the attack tree explores more scenarios. Crowd-sourcing an attack tree reduces the possibility that some options might be overlooked. RATCHET has been tested in classroom settings with positive results.


## Getting Started

These instructions will help you get the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Things you will need to get this to work:

1. A server running PHP
2. MySql database


## Debugging and getting the database connection work

1. Create a database named "ratchet_research"
2. Import the ratchet_research.sql.zip file into the ratchet_research database.
3. Change the username and password in call.php file with your database username and password.

You should be good!
